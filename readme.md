#Project Title

This Project is my final Treehouse Project, I have been working with a local Cancer charity for many years and they happen to need a shiny new site just as I was looking for a project to use in my Treehouse course.

##Getting Started

Prerequisites

The project will need a Mailgun api domain and api key to run. I have created a .env file that has a blank space for these. The domain and key will be included in my project submission.

Starting the application

npm Install
npm start
